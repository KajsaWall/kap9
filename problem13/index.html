        <h1>Grace Hopper</h1>
        <p class="first">Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 - January 1, 1992) was an American
                computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. A pioneer in the field,
                she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and
                invented the first compiler for a computer programming language. She popularized
                the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the
                development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming languages. She is
                credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches
                (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer). The U.S. Navy destroyer
                USS Hopper (DDG-70) is named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer
                at NERSC.</p>

        <h2>World War II</h2>
        <p>In 1943, during World War II, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and
                was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve, one of many women to volunteer to
                serve in the WAVES. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds
                (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg). She reported in
                December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College
                in Northampton, Massachusetts.</p>

        <div id="relative-square">I was below the paragraph i'm above</div> 

        <p>Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of
                Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade.
                She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken.
                Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the
                Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the
                regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her age (38). She
                continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard
                Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor
                of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.</p>
        
                
        <h2>COBOL</h2>
        <p>In the spring of 1959, a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data
                Systems Languages (CODASYL) brought together computer experts from industry and
                government. Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many
                of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new
                language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new
                language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM
                equivalent, COMTRAN. Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a
                language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages
                close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new
                business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language
                to date.</p>
        <p>From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming
                Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was
                promoted to the rank of Captain in 1973. She developed validation software for
                COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire
                Navy.</p>
